# Scotbotics Website - Javascript Navbar Test
## DO NOT MERGE THIS BRANCH WITH MAIN
This is just a test/proof of concept for using Javascript to update the navbar clientside and making it easier to set up new pages and change the navbar
This uses concepts from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32670902/create-multiple-elements and https://www.sitepoint.com/get-url-parameters-with-javascript/
We want the website to work without Javascript, so this wouldn't be practical and we're considering a shell script alternative
