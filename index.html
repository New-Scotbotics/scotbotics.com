	<h2>Who we are</h2>
	<p>We are a competitive robotics team run by high school students based in Piedmont, California. Together, we focus on working as a team to build a robot in addition to having a good high school experience. We were founded in 2009, making us the oldest team in Piedmont, and in the 2021-2022 season we were the 5th oldest team in Northern California.</p>
